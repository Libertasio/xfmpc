General cleanup and add dependency on xfce4-vala

Removed the vapi/ dir because Xfmpc now depends on xfce4-vala. The others vapi
files have been moved to src/.
Removed main-ui.h and main-ui.xml. The code has been moved to main-window.vala.

Fix build problem for Gettext

Dropped useless calls to Xfce.textdomain(). It is only necessary once in the
main function. This worked around a problem to compile the program where
GETTEXT_PACKAGE is not declared before gi18n-lib.h is included. The fix in
this commit is to current it in Makefile.am in the INCLUDES.  Changed default
debug level to yes instead of full in autogen.sh.

2009-07-26	Mike Massonnet <mmassonnet@xfce.org>

Some fixes here and there

- MainWindow had an unused preferences1 object.
- The Preferences singleton function get_default missed a call to
add_weak_pointer to reset the static variable to null once the ref count
reaches 0.
- The default custom format was empty.
- Renamed singleton functions _get to _get_default in Preferences and
Mpdclient.

Update IDEAS

2009-07-21	Mike Massonnet <mmassonnet@xfce.org>

Fixed inconsistent title/sub-title and current song

- In Xfmpc.Interface, renamed the public function clean to reset which must
only be called to reinit/reset the widget to 0, useful when the client gets
disconnected.
- Still in Xfmpc.Interface, fixed numerous title/subtitle inconsistencies. On
update_title, get_title always returned a value != null, therefore now it sets
an appropriate title given MPD is currently playing, stopped or disconnected.
On callback stopped, set pp button to play and call update_title instead of
reset.
- In Xfmpc.MainWindow rename interface to @interface as it is a Vala keyword
and use new renamed function reset instead of clean.
- In Xfmpc.Playlist, a new callback on pp-changed (the current song is unknown
when MPD is stopped and the client is started) and moved the select_row call
inside the refresh_current_song function.

Small fixes with Xfmpc.Statusbar

Drop casting need by changing Gtk.Widget against Xfmpc.Statusbar, it is easier
to handle objects in Vala source code this way.
Add a check "if statusbar != null" before setting the text property.

Improve interaction with mpd

Manage mpd connection in main-window.vala rather than interface.vala. Clean the
interface when disconnected from mpd. In mpdclient, try to connect to mpd in a
thread. Add a new method reload () to mpdclient to clean the playlist and the
dbbrowser when xfmpc is disconnected.

General cleanup and add dependency on xfce4-vala

Removed the vapi/ dir because Xfmpc now depends on xfce4-vala. The others vapi
files have been moved to src/.
Removed main-ui.h and main-ui.xml. The code has been moved to main-window.vala.

Fix build problem for Gettext

Dropped useless calls to Xfce.textdomain(). It is only necessary once in the
main function. This worked around a problem to compile the program where
GETTEXT_PACKAGE is not declared before gi18n-lib.h is included. The fix in
this commit is to current it in Makefile.am in the INCLUDES.  Changed default
debug level to yes instead of full in autogen.sh.
